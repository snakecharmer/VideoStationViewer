# VideoStationViewer
A TVOS Native application to allow someone to link to their Synology NAS and watch their movies.

This is the pre alpha code, currently the aim is to have a barely functioning application ready for Alpha, after that ask for peoples feedback and thoughts to help shape what is most important for the Beta version.

After the application has reached a point you could give it to your grandmother and she could watch a movie then we'll take the silly beta label off it and it's real.

To ask questions then goto Slack https://videostationviewer.slack.com/ or find me on twitter @ztolley

There is a private Jira server being used for scheduling work and setting priorities but this may change to Github if others get involved.
